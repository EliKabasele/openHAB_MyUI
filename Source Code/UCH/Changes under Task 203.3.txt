Main goal: Development of stand alone version. This means UCH was transformed from an .war file that could be deployed in a tomcat server into an .jar file with embedded tomcat server.

This work comprised:
- adjustment of configuration files format and adjusting all related UCH processes

- development of package edu.wisc.trace.uch.launch

- adjust startup process of UCH from starting it with an external tomcat server to one with an embedded server (several handlers required).
