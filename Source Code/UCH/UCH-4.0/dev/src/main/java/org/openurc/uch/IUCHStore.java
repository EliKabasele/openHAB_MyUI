/**
 * In some cases two different modules (UIPMs, TDMs, TAs) may wish to share data with each other. 
 * For this purpose, a shared Map is provided by the UCH, called "local UCH store".  Modules may store data
 * as key-value pairs in the local UCH store, which may be accessed by other (related) modules that know the
 * corresponding keys.  
 *
 * It is recommended that keys are used that will likely not conflict with data written by other modules at 
 * runtime.  Manufacturers of modules should use their domain name as a prefix for their keys, and use dots 
 * as delimiter between key subcomponents.  Example: "example.com.uipm.607.portno".
 *
 * Note that the local UCH store is not a safe place for communicating sensitive information such as 
 * authorization keys, since it can be read by all UIPMs, TDMs and TAs.
